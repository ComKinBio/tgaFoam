# tgaFoam
The ```tgaFoam``` solver is designed for test the biomass pyrolysis kinetics. In this solver, the ```CRECK``` and the ```RAC``` multicomponent reaction schemes are implemented. The reaction schemes can be chosen in the ```constant/coalCloudProperites``` file. The reaction schemes can be modified in the ```constant/reactionProperties``` file.
